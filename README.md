# RS-Terrarium

RS-Terrarium is my attempt at replicating the basic features I need from
[TerrariumPI](https://github.com/theyosh/TerrariumPI).

It is written in rust, because why not and I really like playing around with it.

## Installation

## Configuration

## Development

To create a new build, make sure to have [cross](https://github.com/cross-rs/cross) installed. Then build it:

### Raspberry Pi Zero W

```
cross build --target arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf
```
